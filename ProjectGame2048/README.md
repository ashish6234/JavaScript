# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game in Python. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and the objective is to combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile.

## How to play

To play the game, use the arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into a single tile with the sum of the two numbers. If there are no more moves available, the game is over.

## Installation

To install the game, simply clone this repository and run the `main.py` file.

## Usage
