# 2048 Game

Welcome to the 2048 game repository! This project is a simple yet addictive implementation of the popular 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Challenge yourself to reach the coveted 2048 tile by merging numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid.

## How to Play

Playing the game is easy and fun! Here are the basic rules:

1. Use your arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to move the tiles on the grid.
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.
3. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles strategically.
4. Keep merging and moving until you can't make any more valid moves.

Can you achieve the 2048 tile and become the ultimate 2048 champion?
